# Rarity-AI

**Empowering creators to mint unique NFTs using AI and blockchain technology.**

The NFT Image Generator is an innovative platform that simplifies NFT creation by combining AI-driven image generation with secure blockchain integration. Users input text prompts, receive refined suggestions, generate unique images with rarity indices, and mint their chosen image as an NFT stored in their Supra wallet. Additional features include custom image uploads and NFT transfers.
